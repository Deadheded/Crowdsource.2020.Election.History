# just thoughts for now 

1. Patrick has done a good job of providing much of the how the computer hack was done. I further break this down:

A. Each county involved, along with a detail to the best of our knowledge exactly what and when and how they did this. Much of this is already published 
but should be put together for each place.

B. Tracing of the evolution of the software, both in ownership and use. This should probably be done for each company and all the hardware and software.

C. A list of the known compromises, like solar winds and the malware found on servers. Where they trace back to.

D. A list of names of people involved, from owners down to who’s hands were on what keyboards. Then this should be further developed to a names database 
of all persons who helped both before and after. You could easily start with the 54 former intelligence professionals who signed the letter saying the 
Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. A Wikipedia of evil with lots of backup..

2. Voters. If they were going to create and/or switch a bunch of votes they had to have “names” to put on the ballots. How was this done? One way was a 
great deep dive into names some data analysis did that proved they latterly created fake voters. How are there 100 voters with the last name “Williams” 
who are all 28 years old in GA. In every other age group with the last name “williams” there are 3 or 4 voters. This pattern repeats again and again in 
the 6 counties that stopped voting. Ballot harvesting, there have been people going to jail for this but there is a lot of evidence that there were 100’s 
if not 1000’s of these harvesters working around the country. All the people who were told they voted early when they went to the polls. All the dead 
people and all the people who voted in two states after moving. All of these topics need further investigation and details.

3. Fake ballots, how they got them. How they filled them out when needed. All the strange things the happened around ballots.

4. State officials: Why is the “republican” board of elections of AZ not allowing an audit of the paper ballots? Why is this not happening in all 6 states 
in question? We know the names of each and every state official who are blocking audits. We know all of the officials and members of state legislator who 
pushed to change the voting rules. We know every judge who refused to look at the evidence. We need a list of all of them with connections. We need an 
investigation into each and everyone to see how and when they became compromised.

5. DOJ and FBI and DHS. A list of everyone who did nothing or actively blocked investigations. Find out how and when each and every one of them was compromised.

6. Social Media: Not just Jack and Jeff and other CEOs, we need board members and all “C” level executives and large investors. We need to know everyone of 
them and their connections and when and how they became compromised.

7. MSM: Names, Names, Name. We need to know everyone of them and their connections and when and how they became compromised. All of them from the street reporter 
to the board members. They are dirty and need exposure.

8. One part that is not talked about is how did they get all the workers, in each counting station to go along with this? Or enough of them to get around the
honest ones? I have been doing some investigation and I think I know how they recruited the numbers they need. I will be working on this aspect of the steal either way.
